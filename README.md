# Running the coding assessment Project Steps 
1. Run npm install 
2. Run npm start 
3. Once the project is loaded into localhost, It will ask the user to signup using google to see the data. 
4. Created a dummy data.json in public folder, so that axios should be able to read the file and parse the response
5. Assuming there is an API, that can provides a response for a given month and year and returns the dummy data. 
6. Can use new Date() class to fetch the current year and month and send those params to the axios request. Didn't create one in the project as they are no longer required. 
7. Used redux for store management and used thunk for middleware management. 
8. I already have an google application called stream, that provided me a client token to integrate with google signin API's. 
9. You can signout using the red button shown. 
10. Added unit tests using react-testing-library to all the components. 



# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
